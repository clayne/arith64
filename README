32- and 64-bit arithmetic functions for use with 32-bit GCC.

Some versions of 32-bit GCC may emit calls to external helper functions to
perform certain 32- and 64-bit operations. Normally these functions are
resolved by libgcc.a which is statically linked to the program.

But libgcc may not be usable in some applications, e.g. embedded systems and
linux kernel drivers. In those cases you'll get an linker error such as:

    undefined reference to `__divdi3'

The solution is to link arith64.c to your code, or just copy the required
functions.

Also see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Integer-library-routines.html.

Note not all operations have been implemented, just the ones I've required to
date.

====

'make' performs Monte-Carlo validation testing. Two test executables are
created, one linked to arith64.c and one to libgcc. test.py launches these into
the background and then passes identical sets of random numbers to each,
comparing their outputs. On mismatch it reports error and exits, otherwise it
will run forever, intermittently printing total number of tests performed (in
millions).

(Note your system may require 32-bit compatiblity libraries in order for the
build to succeed. On debian, try "apt install gcc-multilib".)

'make bench' is similar, but for each pair of numbers the executables will
perform each operation one million times and print the average elapsed time in
nanoseconds. This is informational only, press ^C when bored.

'make both' just builds both programs, 'make clean' deletes them.
